Description    
This database project is designed for airline companies to manage its flight information and
customers to check the flight information and make transactions. The entities for the project are
flight info, transaction, customer, card level, airport, airline, plane info, and crew member. In this
database model, customers can check the detailed information about every flight from different
airport to different destination, book their flights according to these information, and get the
corresponding discount and benefits according to their card level. One customer can have only
one card level, but can make many transactions. They can access the flight information but not
the detailed crew members’ info. The airline companies can use this database model to manage
the crew members of each flight, arrange airlines, offer information to customers and set the
criterion for the customer card level. The airline companies should have the privilege to manage
everything in this database model. The data will be acquired from the real airline companies
online. It will only cover a few flights, customers, crew members, destinations… which is enough
to fulfill the function of the database.
